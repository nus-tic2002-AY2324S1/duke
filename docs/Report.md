5. Errors Describe what kind of errors Duke can handle. E.g., give different types of incorrect commands (and the
   expected outputs) it can handle
    - If the user types in an invalid index, CrabY will show the error message and ask the user to type in a valid
      index.

   ![img_10.png](images/img_10.png)

   ![img_13.png](images/img_13.png)

   **Note that:** CrabY can handle cases insensitive and multiple space in the input.

    - If the user types in an invalid date or time, CrabY will show the error message and ask the user to type in a
      valid date or time.

   ![img_14.png](images/img_14.png)

    - If the user puts the blank space in the description or just enter, CrabY will show the error message and ask the
      user to type in a valid description.

   ![img_15.png](images/img_15.png)

    - If the user types in an invalid command, CrabY will still add to the task list.
    - Craby can handel 4 types of the date format, user can put the time or not, if the user doesn't put the time, CrabY
      will put the time to 12:00AM.
        - dd/mm/yyyy hhmm
        - yyyy/mm/dd hhmm
        - dd-mm-yyyy hhmm
        - yyyy-mm-dd hhmm
6. Delete Give examples of command(s) and expected outputs for deleting tasks.

   ![img_16.png](images/img_16.png)

7. Save Give a sample of the tasks as they are stored in the hard disk.

   ![img_17.png](images/img_17.png)

   ** Note that I had covered in case someone wanted to break my data with || which I used to detect when loading data
   files

   example:

   ![img_20.png](images/img_20.png)

8. Dates Give examples (i.e., screenshots of commands and outputs) of how your Duke uses dates/times in meaningful ways
   i.e., what commands can use dates/times in meaningful ways? E.g., is it possible to list deadlines/events on a
   specific
   day? Does it detect invalid dates given by the user?
    - You can add the date and time by using the format `dd/mm/yyyy hhmm` or `yyyy/mm/dd hhmm` or `dd-mm-yyyy hhmm` or
      `yyyy-mm-dd hhmm`.
    - More than that, you can use the natural date format
      e.g.
      `mon` or `monday` will be interpreted as the date of the next Monday in the calendar.
      ...
      `sun` or `sunday` will be interpreted as the date of the next Sunday in the calendar.
      `today` will be interpreted as the date of today in the calendar.
      `tmr` or `tomorrow` will be interpreted as the date of tomorrow in the calendar.
      `eom` or `end of month` will be interpreted as the date of the end of this month in the calendar.
      `eoy` or `end of year` will be interpreted as the date of the end of this year in the calendar.
    - If you don't put the time, the system will put the time to 12:00AM.
    - If the year is the same as the current year, the system will not display the year to make it easier to read.

    ![img_21.png](images/img_21.png)

    - In the event task, if /to same day as /from, the system will only display the date once.

    ![img_22.png](images/img_22.png)

9. Find Give examples of command(s) and expected outputs for searching for tasks.

   ![img_23.png](images/img_23.png)

10. GUI/individual feature If you implement a GUI, give some screenshots. If you implement an individual feature,
    describe that feature.
    - C-Undo
        + You can undo the previous command by typing `undo` and then enter.
        + You can undo the add, delete, mark, unmark, and sort command.
        + You can undo all tasks to the task they start the program.

    - C-Sort
        + You can sort the task list by its type or date and time of the task.
        + If you want to sort the task list by its type, you can type `sort type` or `sort t` and then enter.
        + If you want to sort the task list by its type reverse, you can type `sort type-r` or `sort tr` and then enter.
        + If you want to sort the task list by its date and time, you can type `sort date` or `sort d` and then enter.

    - C-Help
        + You can see the list of commands that you can use by typing `help` and then enter.

    - C-NaturalDates (matching last student number: 3)
        + Support more natural date formats e.g., Mon in a user command can be interpreted as the date of the next
          Monday in the calendar.

11. Other features Describe other features you implement (i.e., not described above), if any e.g., optional increments.

    - When the system starts, the user can choose the checklist that they want to work on.
    - Reason for doing this feature: When I put a lot of tasks in the list, I want to separate them into different
      categories, so I can work on them one by one, and it will be easier to manage.
    - How to use this feature:
        + You can choose the checklist that they want to work on by typing the name of the checklist at the beginning
          of the program.
        + If you want to create a new checklist, they can type the name of the checklist that they want to create.
        + If you type in the name of an existing checklist, they can continue working on the checklist that already has
          the tasks they set before.
        + If you want to switch to another checklist, they can type `switch` and then enter. After that, the user
          can type the checklist name that they want to work on.
        + If you want to see all the checklists that they have created, they can type `checklists` and then enter.
          After that, you can see all the checklists that they have created.
